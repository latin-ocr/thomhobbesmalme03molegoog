TO MR. HOBBES.

Ι.

VAsr bodies of philosophy
1 ost have seen and reed3
But 811 are bodies dead,
Or bodies by art fnshioned.
1 never yet the living soul could see,
But in thy books and thee.
”ris onely God can know
Whether the sair idea thou dost show
Agree entirely with his own or no.
This 1 dare boldly tell,
'Tis so like truth‚ ’twill serve our turn as well.
J nst, as in Nature, thy proportione be,
As snll of concord their varietie,
As firm the parts upon their center rest,
And 811 so solid are, that they at least
Aa much as Nature emptineas detest.
