ΤΟ MR· HOBBES.

VI.

Nor can the snow which now oold nge does shed
Upon thy reverend head,
Queneh or allay the noble fires within ς
But all which thou hast bin,
And all that youth can be, thou'rt yet ς
80 fully still dost thou
Enjoy the manhood and the bloom of wit,
And all the natural heat, but not the sever t'oo.
So contraries on AEtna's top conspire3
Here hom-y froets, and by them breaks out fire.
A secure peace the faithful neighbours keep;
Th· emboldened snow next to the flame does sleep.
And if we weigh‚ like thee,
Nature, and causeo, we shall see
That thus it needs must be ;
To things immor-tal time ean do no wrong;
And that, which never is to die, for ever must be young.

IN ΤΗΟ. HOBBES.

 

Funus exornet barbatos pompa magistros,
Et schola discipulos cogat inepta leves:
Affulsit nova lux tenebroso Hobbesius orbi.

Quanta est laus hominem restituisse sibi?
