To MR. HOBBBS.

11.

Long did the mighty Stagirite retain
The universal intellectual reign,
Saw his own countries short-liv'd leopard alaim
The stronger Roman eagle did out-fly,
Oftener renew’d his age, and saw that dy.
Meeha it sels, in spight of Mahumeh possea,
And chas’d by a wild deluge from the east,
His monarchy new planted in the west.
But as in time each great imperial raee
DegenerateS, and gives some new one place:
So did this noble empire wast,
Sunk by degrees from glories past,
And in the schoolmens hands it perisht quite at last.
Then nought but words it grew,
And those all barb’rous too.
It perisht‚ and it vanisht there:
The life and soul breath’d out became but empty air.

111.

The fields, which answer'd well the ancients plow,
Spent and outworn‚ return no harvest now,
In barren age wild and unglorious lle,
And boast of past fertility,
The poor relies of present poverty.
Food and fruit we now must want,
Unless new lands we plant.
We break up tombs with sacrilegious hands;
Old rubbish we remove;
To walk in mines, like vain ghostS, we love.
And with fond divining wanda
We search among the dead
For treasures buried,

Whilst still the liberal earth does hold
So many virgin-mines of undiscover’d gold.
