ΤΟ MR. HOBBES. V

lv.

The Baltick, Euxine, and the Caspian,
And slender-limb’d Mediterranean,
Seem narrow ereeks to thee, and onely fit
For the poor wretched fisher·boats of wit.
Thy nobler vessel the vast ocean tries,
And nothing sees but seas and skies,
Till unknown regions it doecries;
Thou great Columbus of the golden lands of new philosophie&
Thy task was harder much than his,
For thy learn’d Amerina is
Not onely found out first by thee,
And rudely lest to future industrie ς
But thy eloquence and thy wit
Has planted, peopled, built, and civiliz’d it.

V.

1 little thought before,
(Nor being my own self so poor,

Could oomprehend so vast a store)
That all the wardrobe os rich eloquence

Could have ufforded half enuff,
of bright, of new, and lasting stuff,
To cloath the mighty limbs of thy gigantic sense.
Thy solid reason, like the shield from heaven
To the Trojan heroe given,
Τοο strong to take a mark srom any mor-tal dart,
Yet shines with gold and gems in every part,
And wonder-e on it grav’d by the learn'd hand of art3
A shield that gives delight
Even to the enemies sight,
Then when they‘re sure to lose the combat by·t.
